A nice fancy place and.

25
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,620
The waiter came to our.

26
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,559
Table and he mistook me.

27
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,000
For a man.

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,739
One of my friends responds.

29
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:30,899
Oh she's not a man.

30
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:31,959
She's just a lesbian.

31
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,779
Everyone laughs and the waiter.

32
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:34,479
Apologized.

33
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,459
After he left.

34
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
I asked my friend why.

35
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,319
Did you say that.

36
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:38,840
I have never said or.

37
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,759
Indicated in any way that.

38
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,799

39
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,319

40
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,959
I've never had a boyfriend.

41
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,779
But that's because.

42
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:44,779
I am not interested in.

43
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,099
A romantic relationship but we.

44
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:47,299
Have talked about male celebrities.

45
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,119
We find attractive.

46
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
I thought it was clear.

47
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,139
I was straight.

48
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:51,619
My friend rolled her eyes.

49
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,540
At my question and said.

50
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,599
Oh come on we all.

51
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:54,279
Know you're a lesbian.

52
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,360
I was shocked more friends.

53
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,479
Jumped in and said yeah.

54
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,380
You don't have to lie.

55
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,759
To us.

56
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,060
I wasn't lying.

57
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,540
They started making jokes about.

58
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,540
Me dressing like a lesbian.

59
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,239
Hiding my sexuality being in.

60
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,739
A glass closet everyone knows.

61
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,440
It's 2025 no one cares.

62
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:07,940
Etc.

63
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,559
It all seemed like it.

64
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,360
Wasn't a joke and they.

65
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,239
Actually believed it.

66
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,480
One of my friends.

67
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,620
Eva even joked you were.

68
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,639
Obviously in love with.

69
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:14,900
Ines.

70
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,779
I showed genuine shock at.

71
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:17,860
This remark and she reassured.

72
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,059
Me it's ok we all.

73
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:19,879
Don't mind if you are.

74
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,099
Gay.

75
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,620
Ines was an on off.

76
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,699
Childhood friend of mine and.

77
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:23,919
Our friendship ended badly a.

78
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:24,459
Few months ago.

79
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,699
I was very upset by.

80
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:26,580
It and confided in my.

81
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:26,879
Friends.

82
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,400
I never thought they would.

83
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,199
Use it against me.

84
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,480
I told them firmly that.

85
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,260
I am not a lesbian.

86
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,400
This isn't funny and.

87
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,120
I was not in love.

88
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,319
With.

89
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:33,599
Ines.

90
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:34,900
Once they saw.

91
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,019
I was being serious about.

92
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:37,480
This their tone and attitude.

93
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,419
Became less jokey.

94
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:40,300
They started lecturing me on.

95
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,919
Self acceptance being in denial.

96
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,099
Internalized homophobia.

97
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:45,599
I am not homophobic heteronormativity.

98
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,800
Compulsory heterosexuality etc.

99
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,440
It was like some sort.

100
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,180
Of gay intervention.

101
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,959
I found it absolutely ridiculous.

102
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,120
I yelled at them for.

103
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,099
Being bad friends because.

104
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,040
I couldn't even dress how.

105
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,760
I want or talk to.

106
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,559
Them about my troubles and.

107
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,319
I left the restaurant.

108
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,760
It's the morning after and.

109
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,660
I have serious regret.

110
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,680
I don't know what to.

111
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,180
Say to them and what.

112
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,500
To do.

113
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,000
I ate a.
