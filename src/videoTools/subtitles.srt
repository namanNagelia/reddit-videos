1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
My wife 25F has food

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,780
allergies Shellfish and peanuts are

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,280
her most serious ones but

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,840
she's also allergic to celery

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,939
and soy She's used to

6
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:11,119
people not being willing to

7
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:12,739
accommodate her OR being lazy

8
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:13,760
about it and thinking they

9
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,779
can make food with one

10
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:15,600
of those things in it

11
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,520
and just not putting it

12
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,379
on her plate So Shell

13
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:19,879
normally brings some food if

14
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,280
people seem unsure about what

15
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,120
to do When we first

16
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,879
went to one of my

17
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,420
family's dinners she brought along

18
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,379
some stuff she could eat

19
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:27,420
because my mom had made

20
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,559
it sound like she couldn't

21
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,020
the allergies But when we

22
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,279
got there mom was offended

23
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,439
that she had brought food

24
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,700
We explained why and mom

25
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,139
said in future shed just

26
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:38,279
make food my wife could

27
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,959
eat Ill say this now

28
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:41,939
Before we moved close and

29
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,740
started joining family dinners my

30
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,099
wife and family got along

31
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:46,479
so well and everything was

32
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,340
fine But we moved to

33
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,459
be closer to both our

34
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,500
families 18 months ago My

35
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,700
wife didn't bring anything the

36
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,840
next time and mom had

37
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
something she could eat And

38
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,779
for a few months this

39
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,360
was how it was Then

40
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,400
one of the days she

41
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,919
served something specially for my

42
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:01,919
wife but the rest of

43
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,099
us had shellfish and soy

44
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:04,900
in our food My mom

45
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,339
was not careful about food

46
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:07,360
safety prep and there was

47
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,680
contact between what my wife

48
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,559
ate and what we ate

49
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,540
and my wife had an

50
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,040
allergic reaction Mom said she

51
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,139
felt bad and apologized But

52
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:16,339
then after that dinner she

53
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:17,519
decided it was too much

54
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,459
hassle to make a whole

55
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:19,559
other meal for my wife

56
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:20,680
and then she started making

57
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,760
one meal again but it

58
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,680
was a meal my wife

59
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,800
couldn't eat My wife started

60
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,000
bringing her own food again

61
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,099
but my mom didn't like

62
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:29,099
it After some back and

63
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,099
forth and me talking to

64
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,260
my whole family about the

65
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,540
issue and them saying it

66
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,819
was unfair to expect mom

67
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,019
to cook but she was

68
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,220
still adamant she didn't want

69
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,339
to do something separate for

70
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:38,680
my wife so I told

71
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,540
them it was for the

72
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,500
best if my wife and

73
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,440
I just didn't join them

74
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,339
for these dinners My family

75
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:44,580
did not like this decision

76
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,819
and we have faced criticism

77
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:48,160
for this choice Well I

78
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,620
have They know I decided

79
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,919
to just stop showing up

80
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,220
I told them the health

81
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,300
and safety of my wife

82
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,519
comes first and since she

83
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,699
can't win and she's not

84
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,459
risking another allergic reaction eating

85
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,639
there and it wouldn't be

86
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,519
fair to have her sit

87
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,760
and watch us eat then

88
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,819
not going is our sole

89
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,379
option remaining I ate a
