1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
My fiancé cheated on me.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:01,960
With my father.

3
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,860
Me 27m fiancé 26f call.

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,000
Her.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,739
L my father 52m call.

6
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:06,840
Him.

7
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,319
B my mother 50f call.

8
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:08,439
Her.

9
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:08,619
R.

10
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:09,699
Like many who've had something.

11
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:10,279
Like this happen.

12
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,300
I never thought something like.

13
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,979
This would happen to me.

14
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:12,659
But here we are.

15
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,979
I've never used.

16
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:14,579
Reddit but.

17
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:15,779
I've seen stories from here.

18
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:15,979
On.

19
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:16,520
TikTok so.

20
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,780
I thought.

21
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,680
I'd give this a shot.

22
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,700
For any advice you all.

23
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,180
Could give me.

24
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,760
From listening to some other.

25
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,299
Stories you all like backstory.

26
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:23,260
Ill try and be as.

27
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,180
Clear and precise as.

28
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,239
I can but it's only.

29
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:25,920
Been a week so if.

30
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,760
I start to lose it.

31
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,559
During the telling of this.

32
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,379
I am sorry.

33
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,280
L and.

34
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,059
I met in her freshman.

35
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:31,219
Year of college we were.

36
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,180
Both dorm in the same.

37
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,459
Building where we eventually met.

38
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,060
We later found out we.

39
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,099
Lived two towns away from.

40
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:37,060
Each other so whenever we.

41
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,459
Went home.

42
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,439
I let her drive with.

43
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:38,580
Me.

44
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,139
It was only added like.

45
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:41,220
20 minutes so it was.

46
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,860
No big deal.

47
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,680
After multiple trips and hanging.

48
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,759
Out at school we started.

49
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,119
To date.

50
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:46,439
I have a close knit.

51
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,619
Family as did she so.

52
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,659
We told our families right.

53
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:48,840
Away.

54
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,799
I had met hers plenty.

55
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,860
Of times when dropping her.

56
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,840
Off but it was nothing.

57
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,900
More than an introduction and.

58
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,819
Exchanging pleasantries.

59
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,720
Both of our families accepted.

60
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,819
Each other with open arms.

61
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:57,939
And our relationship grew.

62
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,340
I was a year ahead.

63
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,840
Of her so when.

64
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,380
I graduated.

65
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,319
I went home where.

66
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,099
I was offered a good.

67
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:03,020
Job with great pay.

68
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,580
I visited her at school.

69
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:04,860
Whenever.

70
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,779
I got the chance and.

71
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:06,959
Whenever she came home we.

72
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,800
Would make time for each.

73
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,040
Other.

74
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,059
After she graduated she moved.

75
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:10,819
In with me as both.

76
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:11,580
Of our jobs were in.

77
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,500
The city near where we.

78
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,080
Grew up.

79
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:14,339
Like me she was offered.

80
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:15,260
A position at the company.

81
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,220
She works at now with.

82
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,699
Great pay.

83
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,540
After living together for about.

84
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:18,959
3 years.

85
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,099
I proposed and we have.

86
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,339
Been planning our wedding since.

87
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:22,720
Now on to the part.

88
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,540
You're all reading for.

89
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:24,980
Looking back there was plenty.

90
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,319
Of things.

91
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:25,980
I overlooked that.

92
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,839
I just wrote off thinking.

93
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:27,860
My father was just trying.

94
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,779
To welcome my ex into.

95
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:29,260
Our family.

96
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,019
Things like my father calling.

97
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:31,860
Her all the time and.

98
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:31,940
If.

99
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,919
I was around they would.

100
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:33,660
Just tell me they were.

101
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,879
Talking about the upcoming family.

102
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,040
Party or something along those.

103
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:36,379
Lines.

104
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,500
One time.

105
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,300
Elle was in the shower.

106
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,980
And her phone rang.

107
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,760
I seen it was my.

108
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,400
Dad so.

109
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,459
I answered when he realized.

110
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:41,919
It was me.

111
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,400
He sounded both upset and.

112
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,900
Surprised that.

113
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,279
I picked up.

114
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,139
I then asked what's up.

115
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,080
He responded that he wanted.

116
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,639
To talk to.

117
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,639
Elle about my mother's birthday.

118
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,319
That was in a week.

119
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,160
And after a minute we.

120
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,699
Ended the call.

121
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,459
Even typing this out now.

122
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,239
I feel like an idiot.

123
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,180
For not seeing it sooner.

124
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:53,980
On the day.

125
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,699
I found out it was.

126
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:55,459
Like any other day.

127
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:55,720
Elle had.

128
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,019
Thursdays off so she made.

129
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,160
Breakfast for both of us.

130
00:01:58,739 --> 00:01:58,879
When.

131
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,680
I set out for work.

132
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,639
She gave me a kiss.

133
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:01,319
And told me to have.

134
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:01,959
A great day.

135
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,559
During my drive to work.

136
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,059
I realized.

137
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,279
I had forgotten some paperwork.

138
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,120
I would need for a.

139
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Meeting.

140
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
I had at 3 pm.

141
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,639
I shrugged it off and.

142
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,059
Told myself.

143
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:09,839
I would just go home.

144
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,619
At lunch to get it.

145
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,240
Elle texted me throughout the.

146
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,220
Day talking about all the.

147
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,380
Casual stuff a couple talks.

148
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,080
About like what do you.

149
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,520
Want for dinner.

150
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:16,539
I did the laundry do.

151
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:17,039
You want me to hang.

152
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,960
It up for you blah.

153
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,300
Blah blah.

154
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,919
I didn't think it necessary.

155
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,479
To text her.

156
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,360
I was coming home for.

157
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
Lunch so when it came.

158
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,460
Around.

159
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,600
I just left work and.

160
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,020
Went home.

161
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:24,720
When.

162
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,220
I got home.

163
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,300
I noticed a car that.

164
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,160
Looked like my father's in.

165
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,020
Our parking lot but.

166
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,880
I didn't think anything of.

167
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,720
It and just parked and.

168
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,320
Went into our building.

169
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,139
When.

170
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:31,800
I opened the door.

171
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,759
I was met with a.

172
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,520
Scene out off a movie.

173
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,460
Where a man comes home.

174
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,580
Early and catches his spouse.

175
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,580
Cheating such a cliche.

176
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,119
There was a trail of.

177
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,300
Clothes both his and hers.

178
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Leading to my bedroom and.

179
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,380
The sound of faint moans.

180
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,320
Echoed though my apartment.

181
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,740
I stood at the door.

182
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,779
In utter shock my brain.

183
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:45,619
Was a mix of rage.

184
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,160
Sadness and disgust but if.

185
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,679
You were a fly on.

186
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,779
My wall you would see.

187
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:49,660
What looked like a statue.

188
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,580
I just couldn't move.

189
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,279
When.

190
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,800
I finally snapped to not.

191
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,740
Knowing how much time had.

192
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,039
Passed.

193
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:54,960
I took out my phone.

194
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,360
To record.

195
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,380
I picked up all the.

196
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,119
Clothes that were on the.

197
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:57,899
Floor and threw them into.

198
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:58,619
The hall of the building.

199
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,580
After.

200
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,580
I filmed the walk to.

201
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,759
My bedroom the door was.

202
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:01,960
Open.

203
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,759
I stood in the doorway.

204
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,679
Filming for about a minute.

205
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,759
Then flipped on the lights.

206
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,380
They both jumped at the.

207
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,240
Sudden light and looked at.

208
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,919
Me and to my utter.

209
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,779
Shock it was my father.

210
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:09,440
In the bed with her.

211
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,800
After the initial stun my.

212
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,220
Father noticed.

213
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,279
I was recording and started.

214
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,179
To panic trying to find.

215
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:14,399
Anything to cover himself and.

216
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,399
Telling me to stop recording.

217
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,020
He found a towel and.

218
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,100
Wrapped it around himself and.

219
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,979
Started to walk toward me.

220
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,919
I told him if you.

221
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,639
Don't want to get hurt.

222
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,779
Stop coming to me he.

223
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:22,759
Either didn't care or didn't.

224
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,580
Hear me and reached for.

225
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,979

226
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,479
I hit him square on.

227
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,520
The jaw his head bounced.

228
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,500
Off the door and slumped.

229
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,960
To the ground.

230
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:29,020
El shrieked.

231
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,100

232
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,000

234
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,080
To say to your fiance.

235
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,960
My father woke up after.

236
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,779
About a minute nap and.

237
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:37,199

238
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,960

239
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,899

I sat in my car.

257
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,720
For a while until one.

258
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,520
Of the bosses at work.

259
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,259
Called to ask where.

260
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:57,699

I got to her office.

265
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,039
To hand her the paperwork.

266
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,100
I must have looked awful.

267
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,259
Because she started asking what.

268
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,100
Was wrong with me.

269
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,300
I told her it was.

270
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,479
Nothing and id be okay.

271
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,619
I could see her scanning.

272
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:09,580
Me up and down she.

273
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,520
Noticed some blood on my.

274
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,460
Collar and stood up rushed.

276
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
Bleeding.

277
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,979
I looked down and said.

278
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,080
It was my father's she.

279
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,079
Looked confused so.

280
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,880
I pulled out my phone.

281
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
And showed her the video.

282
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,220
She watched it in its.

283
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,600
Entirety she was introduced to.

284
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,480

285
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,160
Never my father she sat.

286
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,200
There silent for a moment.

287
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,239
Until it finally clicked that.

288
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,359
My fiance was cheating on.

289
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,160
Me but not only was.

290
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,100

My father she asked if.

292
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,660
There was anything she could.

293
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,179
Do suggesting.

294
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,220

But.

296
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:32,859
I told her.

297
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:33,700
I can't go back there.

298
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,899
Right now that.

299
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:39,519
I just need a meeting.

300
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,239
Went over fine.

301
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,019
I put on a smile.

302
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,239
For everyone like nothing had.

306
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
I could do that but.

307
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,540

308
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,279
I don't know and went.

309
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:47,839
To my office.

310
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,579
I then came home and.

311
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,380

312
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,220

00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,600
I carried on so much.

317
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,799
But it was therapeutic getting.

318
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,459
Everything down.

319
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,899
I just don't know what.

320
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,140

00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,119
I defiantly need to get.

322
00:04:59,119 --> 00:04:59,799

Apartment.

324
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,059
I just can't live here.

325
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,140
Anymore and there's no possible.

326
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,380
