00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:17,559
get mistaken for a man

13
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,379
Usually if it's by someone

14
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:20,360

18
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:24,860
I were having dinner at

a nice fancy place and

20
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,620
the waiter came to our

21
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,559
table and he mistook me

22
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,860
for a man One of

23
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,440
my friends responds oh she's

24
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,559
not a man she's just

25
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,439
a lesbian Everyone laughs and

26
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,240
the waiter apologized After he

27
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,439
left I asked my friend

28
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,319
why did you say that

29
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:38,840
I have never said or

30
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,759
indicated in any way that

31
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,799
I am a lesbian because

32
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,400
I am not I've never

33
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,599
had a boyfriend but that's

34
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:44,599
because I am not interested

35
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,020
in a romantic relationship but

36
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,919
we have talked about male

37
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,919
celebrities we find attractive I

38
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:49,720
thought it was clear I

39
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,220
was straight My friend rolled

40
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,200
her eyes at my question

41
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,099
and said oh come on

42
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,279
we all know you're a

43
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,040
lesbian I was shocked more

44
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,200
friends jumped in and said

45
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,240
yeah you don't have to

46
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,779
lie to us I wasn't

47
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,340
lying They started making jokes

48
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,560
about me dressing like a

49
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,139
lesbian hiding my sexuality being

50
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:05,419
in a glass closet everyone

51
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:07,139
knows it's 2025 no one

52
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,180
cares etc It all seemed

53
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,099
like it wasn't a joke

54
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,239
and they actually believed it

55
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,739
One of my friends Eva

56
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,019
even joked you were obviously

57
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,760
in love with Ines I

58
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,940
showed genuine shock at this

59
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,019
remark and she reassured me

60
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,319
it's ok we all don't

61
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,099
mind if you are gay

62
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,620
Ines was an on off

63
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,699
childhood friend of mine and

64
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:23,919
our friendship ended badly a

65
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:24,959
few months ago I was

66
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,959
very upset by it and

67
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,680
confided in my friends I

68
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,599
never thought they would use

69
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,800
it against me I told

70
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,760
them firmly that I am

71
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,000
not a lesbian this isn't

72
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,819
funny and I was not

73
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,519
in love with Ines Once

74
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,419
they saw I was being

75
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:36,980
serious about this their tone

76
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,419
and attitude became less jokey

77
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:40,300
They started lecturing me on

78
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,919
self acceptance being in denial

79
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,940
internalized homophobia I am not

80
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,800
homophobic heteronormativity compulsory heterosexuality etc

81
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,440
It was like some sort

82
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,980
of gay intervention I found

83
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,739
it absolutely ridiculous I yelled

84
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:53,559
at them for being bad

85
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,680
friends because I couldn't even

86
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,480
dress how I want or

87
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,180
talk to them about my

88
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,059
troubles and I left the

89
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:58,599
restaurant It's the morning after

90
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,660
and I have serious regret

91
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,660
I don't know what to

92
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,180
say to them and what

93
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,000
to do I ate a
