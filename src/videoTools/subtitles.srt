00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Title The Pregnant Paws Disaster

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,079
at Lunch Scene Office Cafeteria

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,639
The team is gathered around

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,739
a large table celebrating Linda's

5
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:12,460
successful probation Plates of food

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,800
and drinks are spread out

7
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,600
Laughter fills the air as

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,780
everyone shares stories Narrator So

9
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:20,239
three months ago we had

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,340
a new co worker join

11
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,399
us Let's call her Linda

12
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:25,479
Linda seemed nice enough like

13
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:26,479
the kind of person who

14
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,920
always has gum and shares

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,520
it So naturally I wasn't

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,360
sure what to make of

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,340
what happened next Narrator We

18
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,020
have this team tradition When

19
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,560
a new employee survives the

20
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,319
probation period we celebrate with

21
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,380
a team lunch It's usually

22
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,060
something nice but wallet friendly

23
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,180
because let's be honest corporate

24
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,700
budgets don't exactly scream extravagant

25
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,020
Linda breezed through her probation

26
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,319
like a pro so we

27
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,240
head out for lunch Things

28
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,740
start off casual like a

29
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,080
scene from a sitcom where

30
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,939
everyone's having a great time

31
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,599
Camera pans to the group

32
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:02,319
eating chatting and laughing Narrator

33
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,620
And then oh boy the

34
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,919
topic of the magic of

35
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:08,819
pregnancy childbirth came up Cue

36
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,519
the Kodak moments and Hallmark

37
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,860
card sentiments Everyone was sharing

38
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,959
sweet baby bump tales think

39
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,459
glowing not imploding I joined

40
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,720
in enthusiastically nodding like a

41
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,040
bobblehead but keeping mum about

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,139
my own experience Linda Turns

43
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:26,220
to me eyes sparkling you

44
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,480
had twins didn't you That

45
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,419
must have been a double

46
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:32,059
dose of wonderful Narrator I

47
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,940
smile thinking if only she

48
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,980
knew So I say something

49
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,959
along the lines of how

50
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,339
I wished my pregnancy and

51
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:39,480
birth had been as positive

52
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,639
as theirs I swear it

53
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,699
wasn't dripping with sarcasm but

54
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,099
on the inside all I

55
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:46,739
could think was cut to

56
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,980
a comically exaggerated dream sequence

57
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,819
The narrator is a pregnant

58
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,980
woman dealing with dramatic horrific

59
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,800
symptoms Nightmares featuring giant vegetables

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,819
rivers of morning sickness and

61
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,139
migraines that throb to the

62
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,400
beat of we will rock

63
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,660
you Narrator To summarize my

64
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,120
pregnancy was like if Stephen

65
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,720
King directed a rom com

66
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
Back to lunch scene the

67
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,800
narrator's face now visibly strained

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,119
but still smiling Narrator Now

69
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,500
if I'd really unleashed the

70
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,899
horror story I doubt there'd

71
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:18,500
have been any celebratory ice

72
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,880
cream cones left unscarred So

73
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,440
I kept it simple But

74
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,559
Linda bless her reactionary heart

75
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,039
seemed to bristle Linda Her

76
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,160
demeanor shifts slightly tone icy

77
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,119
really That's unfortunate narrator After

78
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,440
the lunch I pull Linda

79
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,979
aside and in my best

80
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:37,339
trying to be diplomatic but

81
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,679
totally confused voice ask her

82
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,080
what's wrong Instead of unloading

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,960
some psychological thriller level motive

84
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,539
she calls me insensitive According

85
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,259
to her my little comment

86
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,679
had apparently undermined their beautiful

87
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:53,059
motherhood experiences qualifying me as

88
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,940
the office a hole Cut

89
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,720
to comedic montage Narrator attempting

90
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,100
everyday tasks while horrifying pregnancy

91
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,779
flashbacks distract her ultimately screwing

92
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:04,279
up each task in slapstick

93
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:07,580
style Narrator Now she's cooled

94
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,380
off a bit Think lukewarm

95
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,020
tea but last week she

96
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,419
organized a night And guess

97
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,500
who didn't make the invite

98
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,759
list Yours truly Not that

99
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,020
I live for these gatherings

100
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,639
but the exclusion had awkward

101
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,539
written all over it The

102
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,179
vibe in the office Might

103
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:24,160
as well be an episode

104
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,919
of The Office post Michael

105
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,880
Scott Narrator Drama is the

106
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,339
last thing I need My

107
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,720
life could already star in

108
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,000
a daytime soap So I

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,339
haven't confronted her about it

110
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,639
I mean Linda's generally nice

111
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,720
the type to ask how

112
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,279
your cat's doing remember the

113
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,000
cat's name and genuinely care

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,279
about the answer So the

115
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,300
burning question remains Was I

116
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,000
really an a hole Did

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,520
my honesty clash with the

118
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,199
fairy tale narrative too harshly

119
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,059
Before I approach her I

120
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:55,559
need some perspective Seriously Aida

121
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,279
Scene fades as the narrator

122
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,539
looks around with a puzzled

123
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,240
and thoughtful expression while the

124
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,600
team chatters on The end
